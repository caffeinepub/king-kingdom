  "summary": "REQ-1 appears implemented via an updated central contact config exposing both phone numbers with correct display strings and tel: links, plus a backward-compatible primary phone field. REQ-2 appears implemented for TopBar, Footer contact area, and ContactSection contact-info via mapping over CONTACT_INFO.phones. REQ-3 is only partially evidenced: the ContactSection \"Call Now\" uses CONTACT_INFO.phone.tel, but there is no diff evidence that the header navigation \"Call Now\" CTA was updated/verified to use the primary phone after the config change.",

      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "The \"Call Now\" button in the header navigation works and opens a tel: link for a valid phone number (deterministically the primary/first number) after adding the second phone number.",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows ContactSection's \"Call Now\" uses CONTACT_INFO.phone.tel, but there is no change or snippet for the header navigation component to confirm it still points to a valid tel: link after the contact config was refactored.",
