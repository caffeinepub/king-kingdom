# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove CCS logo imagery from the site header, footer, and favicon so branding appears as text only.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the header brand area to render brand text only (no CCS logo image) while keeping the brand control clickable to scroll to the Home section.
- Update the footer brand block to render brand text only (no CCS logo image) and adjust spacing/alignment as needed.
- Remove the favicon reference to `/assets/generated/ccs-favicon.dim_64x64.png` from `frontend/index.html`.

**User-visible outcome:** The site shows brand text (no logo image) in the header and footer, and no longer uses the CCS logo favicon, with layout remaining visually balanced across mobile and desktop.
