# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add the existing CCS logo to the main footer brand area and align it with the footer brand text to match the header’s branding pattern.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the footer left-column brand block to render `/assets/generated/ccs-logo-square.dim_1024x1024.png` with appropriate alt text (e.g., “CCS Logo”).
- Adjust footer brand layout/styling so the logo and brand text are horizontally aligned, visually balanced, and remain readable with proper spacing on mobile.
- Keep all existing footer content, links, and responsive behavior unchanged while applying consistent spacing/typography with the current design system.

**User-visible outcome:** The footer’s left brand section shows the CCS logo next to the brand text in a clean, responsive layout consistent with the site header.
